This is done on a Pretrained model.
Someone else made a ML model which knows how to classify images and ML5 load it and helped us to use it in our code.

About the Model:-

The model expects an input and it expects it to be an image.With this input the model generatess an output and it will be a class( i.e; Cat, Dog, Mukan etc. ) and a confidence score( 98%, 99.99%, etc). 
How can the model do that?
-> It's because somebody have trained the model using supervised learning


SUPERVISED LEARNING
-> supervised learning invilves a dataset which have one coloum as a lot of inputs and another column with alot of outputs.
